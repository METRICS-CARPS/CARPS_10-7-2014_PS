This markdown serves to reproduce Gilead & Liberman (2014) results for the Checking Analytic Reproducibility at Psychological Science (CARPS) Project.

I first read the background on the pre-registered protocol found on OSF. Then, I identified my article (10-7-2014 PS) and cloned the repo on my desktop github, and will now install the CARPS Reports Project using the RPubs code.

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

```{r}
devtools::install_github("METRICS-CARPS/CARPSreports")
library(CARPSreports)
```
