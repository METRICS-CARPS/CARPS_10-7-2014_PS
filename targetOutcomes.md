For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> We conducted a factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with caregiving (caregiving salience vs. no caregiving
salience) and threat (out-group threat vs. natural threat)
as independent variables and out-group bias as the
dependent variable. The results showed a significant
interaction between caregiving and threat, F(1, 282) =
4.220, p = .041, ηp2 = .014 (Fig. 1). Simple-effects analysis
revealed that in the out-group-threat condition, participants
who were primed for caregiving salience showed
significantly higher levels of out-group bias (M = 0.851, SD = 0.528) than did the no-caregiving-salience group (M = 0.654, SD = 0.488), F(1, 282), p = .027, Cohen’s d =
0.387. In the natural-threat condition, there was no difference
between participants in the caregiving-salience
(M = 0.703, SD = 0.594) and no-caregiving-salience (M =
0.773, SD = 0.583) groups, F < 1. No further effects
attained significance.
